## The big picture
All knowledge is conjectural (an educated guess). The best theories (like the theory of evolution, theory of computation, quantum theory, etc) are constructed so that they make specific guesses/descriptions of something that can either be right or wrong (ie falsifiable) and are not easy to vary. The game of science is a never ending game in which we search for more accurate descriptions of the phenomanae we can see around us. 

An effective learning pedagogy (system of learning) involves creating blocks of time to focus on difficult problems and reviewing past concepts to maintain fluency with older topics. 

Systematic apporaches are easier to troubleshoot / error correct than unorganized appraoches. By dividing the problem solving process into multiple stages and emphasizing critical thinking about what is going on in each step, students can get an idea of how to proceed under uncertainty and how to ask specific questions to address misunderstandings with a problem.

## Epistemology, Learning Pedagogy, and Problem Solving
This session is an introductory session that is meant to give you some of the most important fundamentals that any scientist, mathematician, and engineer SHOULD know but often times do not know. Although one need not know some of these concepts in order to do interesting work in the quantatative realm, having a robust theory of knowledge, an evidence based learning strategy, and a systematic approach to problem solving can help streamline any quantatative endeavor. Moreover, knowledge of these fundamentals helps one accuractely communicate their work to broad audiences and provide insight on potential shortcomings or extensions of an idea/project. 

## Epistemology
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge. Historically, many figures can be crudely classified as rationalist or empiricists. The rationalists, epitomized by Plato, are the folks that try to reason things from first principles. Rationalist are known for devising clever theories and framing problems in interesting ways that lend themselves to abstract methods of analysis. On the other hand, rationalists like to make observations and generate descriptions based on the results of the observations. The quintessential empiricist is Aristotle, and empiricists are known to devise clever experiments in order to make interesting observations.

Epistemology is chiefly concerned with identifying whether a problem is physical or metaphysical. A physical problem is one that can be reduced to a series of statements that can either be true or false. For example, a physical statement might be "the temperature at the end of the rod of steel is 70 degrees Fahrenheit after being stored in a container at room temperature for a month". One can readily devise an experiment so that we can observe whether or not this is the case. A metaphysical statement on the other hand is neither true nor false. A popular example might be "The foreign policy of [insert country] is overall a global force for good". Although one may still construct compelling arguments for why a particular country is or is not a global force for good, there is no way to declare the statement as true or false. For metaphysical statements, answers depend on criteria and values that a problem solver uses when addressing a problem. For example, a particular policy might be great from a utiliatarian perspective, but terrible from an ethical persepctive. Many of the most important, interesting problems are metaphysical in nature and cannot be robustly addressed using only scientific methods of inquiry. Science revolves the physical worlds, and by definition is only concerned with the class of statements that are either true or false. 

### Popper's Philosophy of Science -- Rationalism AND Empiricism
One may realize from above that both rationalism and empiricism are important modes of thought that serve as primary fuel source of the engine of science. First off, we want to be able to reason about things abstracly because no one can run an experiment on every possible thing that can happen, observe the outcome, and then store that information in a meaningful way to solve new problems. Rationalism allows us to come up with good explanations, and often resorts to logical statements in order to have precise meanings assigned to statements and methods of verifying/falsifying statements. On the other hand, many ideas that seem true in theory land can readily be disproved by experiments. The observe and experiment emphasis that is built into the empiricist school of thought allows for easy error identification and correction. Thus, by a continual process of observation, reasoning, and experimentation, empiricists strive to reach truth in a way that allows for easy updates to flaws in reasoning. In the 1900s, a philsopher by the name of Karl Popper wrote a couple of important books on the subject of epistemology that put the philosophy of science on much firmer grounds than the grounds of rationalism or empiricism. Past thinkers such as Francis Bacon were aware that both pure rationalism and pure empiricism have their shortcomings. Popper, however, is famous for his demarcation of what is scientific and what is not scientific. As Popper puts it “In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable: and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality.” Later thinkers, such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb and David Deutsch, expand this idea and find ways to apply it in the real world. For example, Dave Deutsch has remarked "Science is objective. And in my view we cannot take any experimental results seriuously except in the light of good explanations". One may wonder how one deems a certain explanation good and another one bad. The key distinction between a good explanation and a bad explanation is that good explanations are hard to vary. This means that it should be as specific as possible and not allow for multiple interpretations of what is going on in a phenomanae. For example, one might say that the current state of meteorology can describe weather better than how the ancient Greeks described weather. Current meteorology uses tried and true quantatative principles and physical principles to make fairly specific, accurate predictions of the weather. Within a small enough timeframe (say about 2 or 3 weeks), these models are suprisingly accurate. Furthermore, they pose the problem in a way that makes affirmative statements about what will happen and allows us to use measurement apparatuses to either verify or falsify predictive statements about the weather. Contrasting this with the myth of Persephone, which allows for many ad hoc explanations and easy variations about what is going on, one can see that using modern meteorology is a far superior method of understanding, describing, and predicting the weather than trusting in the ancient gods and the human intermediaries that dispense there message. Although this example may seem rather silly, it is the example that Deutsch uses in "The Beggining of Infinity" and drives home the point that falsifiable, hard to vary explanations provide a better mechanism for understanding the natural world than metaphysical explanations. Popper eloquently remarked "Theories are nets cast to catch what we call 'the world': to rationalize it, to explain, and to master it. We endeavor to make the mesh ever finer and finer"

## Learning Pedagogy
A learning pedagogy is simply an approach to learning. Everyone has their own learning style, so this is not meant to give you an algorithm you must repeat everytime as much as it is to give you a framework to start with that you can modify to accomodate your own needs / style. 

### Spatial Repetition 
Everyone has heard the expression "Practice makes perfect". The more we do something, the better we get at it. So if it's all about just practice and repping it out, why don't I just assign a bunch of worksheets and have you all mindlessly crank out problems until it is eventually solidified in your brain? WELL IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE (sigh). Practice certainly makes perfect, but strategizing ones training regiment can lead to far superior results as opposed to just "feeling it out" and not planning things. The key insight behind the spatial repetition is that humans forget things over time and that we must habitually practice some skills in order to retain them for long periods of time. For example, think about all of those trig identities that you were most likely shown at some point. Admittedly, I would be embarrassed to try and list them all out now myself. Many people struggle to internalize the concept of trig identities (and many more areas of math) because they are simply shown/explained once before someone hands you a paper full of computations to carry out before moving on to the next topic. Thus, one must routintely visit old topics and practice them in order to retain efficiency. The longer we wait to practice an old topic, the worse we become at it. In particular, people should try and focus on refreshing topics that are fundamental to the subject as well as topics that you personally struggle with within a topic. For exaxmple, one must be able to solve systems of equations in order to be able to do calculus at a high level. Thus, one should make sure that they get enough practice manipulating equations into simpler forms so that it becomes more straightforward to understand and solve calculus problems. If this prerequisite skill is not adequately sharp, one will struggle to solve non-trivial problemns in calculus. Math and science are subjects in which the fundamentals are of such cruicial importance that one must have solid enough fundamentals in order to be great.

As one can see from the chart above, the longer one waits, the more difficult it is to resharpen that particular tool. This does not mean that everyone should practice every single thing that they have learned in the past on any given day. Some people might wait days, some weeks, and others might wait until a test or project forces them to recall that information. Part of becoming a life-long learner is coming up with a system that works for you and knowing yourself well enough to be able to honestly assess your abilities and determine what you should work on to be the best version of yourself. The most specific advice that I could give on such a varying, multifaceted problem is that you must practice skills in order to retain them. A student must decide how much time to split between learning new topics and reviewing old topics, which topics to review, and the time window that one must practice a topic in order to retain it. 

### Deep Work
Deep Work is a term coined by Cal Newport which describes his system for maximizing the productivity of his work/learning sessions. Once again, these insights probably have occured to you at some point and might seem obvious, but for completeness I will briefly describe the main points. A deep work session is one in which the amount of external distractions is minimized and critical thinking about non-trivial parts of a problem is maximized. When one is working on a difficult problem in math or science, one must think slowly and carefully about their logic and how it addressses the problem at hand. For a difficult problem, one simple mistake can invalidate one's answer entirely. One can beautifully and creatively apply amazing ideas to solve a problem, but if one makes a simple arithmetic mistake, or solves a system of equations wrong, or forgets adding a constant term, etc etc etc, then all of those amazing insights still give you the wrong answer. Thus, one must put themselves in a position to minimze trivial mistakes and to be able to string together a series of ideas with perfect precision in order to solve a problem. This may sound daunting at first, and will certainly take persistent practice to do at a high level. As you all start solving more advanced problems, you may begin to value the wisdom contained in this methodology.

Some quick notes ; there is a time and place for multitasking. Sometimes one cannot make progress on a certain assignment (this can be caused by a variety of reasons) and must move on to something else rather than beating one's head on a wall for hours on end. One must not be too quick to give up on a problem, because very few problem solvers get something right away and solve it right away. It's okay to be wrong, it is okay to do some work and realize that your approach is flawed, and it is okay to not know what to do and think about it for a little bit. Students must be able to decide for themselves if they gave an honest effort, and to ask for help after an honest effort has been given so that misunderstandings can be corrected. A general rule of thumb is that one should ATLEAST give 30 minutes of attention focused effort on a problem before asking for help or taking a break. I have personally met people who aim for sessions of 2 and a half to 3 hours, but this is on the more extreme end of the spectrum and is something that must be worked up towards. Lastly, the concept of deep work is best applied to creative, non-trivial tasks that require critical thinking in order to solve. Thus, one need not to adhere to this methodology in cases where a person has lots trivial problems to solve. For example, if I hand you a multiplcation worksheet and tell you to crank out a bunch of multiplication problems, one may not need to set aside an entire block of time to finish that assignment in its entirety because multiplcation should be fairly trivial and becasuse it isn't as difficult to start the assignment back up if you decide to take a break. I would not advise doing this if you are solving a multi-step problem or otherwise difficult problem, because quiting midway through a compicated problem causes one to have to go over the problem again once they go back to it and increases the likelihood of making an error. Thus, if you can't get a focused seession in, I would advise solving the simplest, quickest problems first and allocating blocks of focused time to for your most difficult assignments.

## Problem Solving
Problem solving is an open-ended, creative endeavor. The game of science only ends when we decide to stop playing it, and the motivated problem solver is always looking for new problems to solve or simpler, more elegant explanations of what they already know. Everybody is going to have their own problem solving style, but it can certainly be beneficial to some to take more of a systematic approach to solving problems and only resorting to "summoning the muse", "freestyling it", or "following your intuition" when systematic approaches do not yield desired results. The system below was devised by George Polya, a renowned mathemitician and math popularizer that wrote one of the most cherised books in the mathematics community. Following Polya's 4 step process can yield results on a very wide class of problems, and also allows one to identify issues/struggles in solving a problem more accurately because it helps pinpoint what part of the problem you are struggling with. It is not uncommon for students to be so eager to rush towards solving a problem that they do not understand the problem accurately and start solving a completely different problem. Other students understand a problem well but have no idea where to start or how to start sketching out a solution. Some students might understand the problem and know how to solve it, but might be making errors in the process of solving a problem. Finally, a student may carry out the first 3 steps just fine and get the right answer, but a better explanation might exist that makes it esaier to internalize the problem and use the information in that problem to solve similar problems in a more straight-forward manner. Accurately identifying what part of a problem you a struggling with as much specificity as possible makes it easier to ask fruitful questions and for helpers to address your needs better.
